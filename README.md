Algorithm
An algorithm is a procedure having well defined steps for solving a particular problem. Algorithm is 
finite set of logic or instructions, written in order for accomplish the certain predefined task. 
It is not the complete program or code, it is just a solution (logic) of a problem,
 which can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or Pseudo code.

The major categories of algorithms are given below:

Sort: Algorithm developed for sorting the items in certain order.
Search: Algorithm developed for searching the items inside a data structure.
Delete: Algorithm developed for deleting the existing element from the data structure.
Insert: Algorithm developed for inserting an item inside a data structure.
Update: Algorithm developed for updating the existing element inside a data structure.
